# Multi-Agent-Pathfinding-with-A-star

Implemented the Standard Admissible Algorithm A* with operator decomposition. It is based on this paper: Standley, T. (2010). Finding Optimal Solutions to Cooperative Pathfinding Problems. Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 24(1), 173-178. https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v24i1.7564

The code can be run by running by executing the file my_pathfinding_world.py:\
```python3 my_pathfinding_world.py $num_agents $random_seed```
